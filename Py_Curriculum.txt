
This course will provide a gentle, yet intense, introduction to
programming using Python for highly motivated students with
little or no prior experience in programming.
The course will focus on planning and organizing programs, 
as well as the grammar of the Python programming language.

Python is one of the languages that is witnessing incredible growth 
and popularity year by year. In 2017, Stackoverflow 
calculated that python would beat all other 
programming languages by 2020 as it has become the fastest-growing programming language in the world.
